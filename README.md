This simple HTML video app allows you to use your iOS camera as a video source that covers the entire screen, without being obstructed by any camera controls.  This is the perfect solution for recording from your MacBook with QuickTime, while using your iPhone as the camera source.

#### Usage
Go to this address on your iOS Device: https://trevcan.github.io/camera-viewer/

Pinch zoom in/out on iPhone until video fits to screen.  Double tap on the video to switch between cameras (i.e. front/back).

**Tested with:**
- iPhone 6S (iOS 14.3)
- iPad Mini 4th gen (iPadOS 14.6)
- iPhone X (iOS 13.2.1)
- MacOS 10.14.6+ (Mojave)
